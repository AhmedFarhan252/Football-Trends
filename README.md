## Project Details

The project involved using the Techniques and Practices of Data Science to answer the some questions related to International Football Matches. The datasets used for this project can be found in the Reference Section (below). The datasets were used to answer the following questions:

1. Does home advantage play a role in a team's performance?

2. What are the trends of goals-scored per match over the years?

3. Which Countries are the most consistent at the highest levels?

4. What days, months, and seasons are the most popular for International Matches?

5. What are the trends in goals scored at home vs goals scored away?

6. Which Countries are the most attacking or most defensive?

7. What are the trends of top performing countries over the years?

8. Are Germans the best penalty takers?

The project workflow consisted of the following operations:

1. **Data Cleaning** to remove unwanted data, missing data, and to extract required information.
2. **Data Visualization** to view graphical relationships inherent within the data that may help to answer the questions.
3. Predicting Football World Cup 2018 results using a **Multinomial Logistic Regression Classifier**

Details of the process as well as the results can be found in the Medium Article linked above.
